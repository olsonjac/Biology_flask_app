# Biology_flask_app
This is the flask application that hosts a transcription and translation tool online that was created previously in python. 

The files included create a simple website using the lightweight flask framework that allows online users to transcribe and translate DNA sequences.


Gunicorn was used for the wsgi and Nginx was used for the general hosting of the site.
